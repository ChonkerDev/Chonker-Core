XCVG Systems - Rigged/Animated Humanoid

This is a rigged and animated humanoid. It's relatively low poly at under 1000 tris. The rig isn't great, but it mostly works. This is set up for Unity, with the correct scaling and orientation. The rig qualifies as a humanoid and retargeting works pretty well, though you might have to manually hook up some of the bones.
